"""An operator can shrink a chart of accounts they did not choose (#139).

Reported by tresero, arriving from hledger with their own chart. A new
company is seeded with 57 accounts and, before this, **none of them could be
removed or hidden**:

  * `delete_account` refused anything carrying `is_system`, and all 57 carry
    it — so delete was refused for every seeded account, forever, even on a
    company with no transactions;
  * the Chart of Accounts page had no deactivate control at all, so the
    "Deactivate it instead" advice in our own delete error was something the
    interface could not do.

That is the same wrong flag 2.10.2 found hiding the Edit button, in a second
place. The gate is the control-account registry: fifteen numbers the posting
code resolves literally and a document that cannot find one is #119. Those
can be renamed, never removed. The other forty-two are ordinary accounts.
