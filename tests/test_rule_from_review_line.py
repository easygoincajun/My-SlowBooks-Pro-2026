"""A bank rule from a statement line in To review (#259, 2.22.2).

Rules suggested categories for imported lines, but making one was a
separate form where the pattern and the account were typed from scratch,
though the review row already had the payee and the category chosen. Now
"Rule…" on a review line opens the rule form with both filled in; saved,
the rules run over the queue and the register comes back.
