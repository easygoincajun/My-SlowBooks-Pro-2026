"""Retry-safe request identity for the payment-recording routes (#292).

A client that may retry — a form after a lost response, an agent, a
script — sends an ``Idempotency-Key`` header. The route reserves the key
before it writes anything, in the same transaction as the payment, and
stores the response under it before the commit:

- the same key with the same body returns the stored response (the
  payment was booked once);
- the same key with a different body is refused (409): a key names one
  intended payment;
- a key whose first delivery is still running is refused (409) until it
  finishes — two concurrent deliveries book one payment;
- no header: an ordinary POST, as before.

Keys are kept for RETENTION_DAYS; a retry later than that is a new request.
