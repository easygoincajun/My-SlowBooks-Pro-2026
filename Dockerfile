# with FORCE_HTTPS=true /health answers http with a 307 to https, and chasing
# that to a non-TLS port would flap the container unhealthy while the worker
# is fine — so a 2xx or 3xx both count as alive. Marks unhealthy after
# 3 consecutive failures (90s): short enough for orchestrators to restart
# promptly, long enough to ride out a single GC pause or migration replay.
